# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is built using the Nodejs, if you do not have Nodejs download nodejs with the following link: https://nodejs.org/en/download

## New to NodeJS?

Links to download nodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/download

Once installed you may have to include the installtion path onto your environment variables:

Mine are as follows:
(User variables under PATH)
C:\Users\Kalryn.Barnes\AppData\Roaming\npm

(System variables under PATH)
C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs\

This will allow you to use the npm CLI

## Available Scripts

In the project root directory (epi-use-ocr-solution), you can run:

### `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/`

This will set your npm registry to the standard registry, which may remove the use of proxies

### `npm install`

Once you have pulled the project from the git repo, navigate to the root directory of the project and run npm install, this will initalize the nessecery dependencies required from the application

There are some dependencies that have caused headaches in the past as npm install does not fully install them these are:
X:
X:
X:

To install these modules you may need to run

npm install X

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Once you are all set and the project has successfully installed the necessary dependencies you can run npm start which will start the application in developer mode in (http://localhost:3000)

And that should be it all in all, hope you enjoy and happy hunting
